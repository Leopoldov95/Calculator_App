## General Info
This is a simple yet functioning calculator I created sith plain HTML, CSS, and javaScript. This was a challenging yet fun project to tackle as I learned alot about handling events as well as ensuring that this calculator has various features (more information on features below).

## Technologies
This app was created with the following technologies:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* javaScript

## Features
This app was created to resemble a simple yet working calculator:
* The output handles large, overflowing results and returns their exponential notation (so 1000000000000000 will be shown as 1.000000000e+15 to fit the output screen)
* This calculator supports decimal useage
* This calculator allows the user to combine operators (for example, the user can calculate/input a calculation such as 3 + 7 * 5 / 4 - 5 + 2 without having to press the EQUAL button after every single operation).
